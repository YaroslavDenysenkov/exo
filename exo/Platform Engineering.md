[[Internal Developer Platform]]
[[Golden Path]]

Platform engineering ==builds and maintains **Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)**, creating self-service tools, workflows, and environments (like standardized pipelines, infrastructure, and monitoring) that abstract complexity, allowing development teams to build, deploy, and manage applications faster, more securely, and with less cognitive load, effectively applying== [DevOps principles at scale for modern cloud-native apps](https://www.dynatrace.com/solutions/platform-engineering/). It treats the platform as a product for developers, improving their experience and speeding up time-to-market. 

Core Concepts

- **Internal Developer Platform (IDP):** A product offering a unified, self-service experience for developers, providing necessary tools and automation.
- **[Golden Paths](https://www.google.com/search?q=Golden+Paths&oq=what+is+Platfro&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCwgBEAAYChgLGIAEMgYIABBFGDkyCwgBEAAYChgLGIAEMgsIAhAAGAoYCxiABDILCAMQABgKGAsYgAQyCwgEEAAYChgLGIAEMgsIBRAAGAoYCxiABDILCAYQABgKGAsYgAQyCwgHEAAYChgLGIAEMgsICBAAGAoYCxiABDILCAkQABgKGAsYgATSAQgzMzM5ajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&ved=2ahUKEwiZgLH2w9mRAxW7R_EDHVhELDIQgK4QegYIAQgAEA0):** Pre-configured, secure, and compliant workflows (e.g., CI/CD, deployment) that developers can easily follow.
- **Self-Service:** Developers can provision resources and perform tasks independently without involving other teams.- **Abstraction:** Hides complex infrastructure details (like Kubernetes, cloud services) so developers focus on code. 

Key Goals & Benefits

- **Boost Developer Productivity:** Streamlines processes, reduces interruptions.
- **Improve Efficiency:** Faster development, testing, and deployment cycles.
- **Enhance Security & Compliance:** Standardizes security and governance within the platform.
- **Reduce Cognitive Load:** Less for developers to manage across different tools.
- **Achieve Scale:** Enables large teams to work consistently and efficiently. 

How it Works

Platform engineering teams (the "platform team") build the IDP, treating developers as their internal customers. They provide: - Automated provisioning (infrastructure, databases)
- Standardized CI/CD pipelines
- Centralized observability (logging, monitoring)
- Access to tools and services through a central portal. 

Platform Engineering vs. DevOps

While related, DevOps is a cultural practice, whereas platform engineering is a discipline focused on building the tools (the IDP) that _enable_ DevOps principles at scale, making it easier for developers to follow those practices.
