### Amazon Description

In **INSPIRED**, product thought leader Marty Cagan revealed **the best practices and techniques used by the top product teams operating in the product model**. Next, **EMPOWERED** shared **the best practices and techniques used by the top product leaders to provide their teams with the kind of environment they need to thrive in the product model**.

Yet, the most common question after reading INSPIRED and EMPOWERED has been: "Yes, we want to work this way, but the way we work today is so different, and so deeply ingrained, is it even possible for a company like ours to transform to the product model?"

**TRANSFORMED was written to bridge the gap between where most companies are right now and where they need to be.** The leaders of these companies know they must transform to compete in an era of rapidly changing enabling technology, but most of them have never operated this way before. **TRANSFORMED** has three big goals:

- **First**, the book will educate you with a **deep understanding of the product operating model**, and what it means to work that way.
- **Second**, the book will convince you with **detailed case studies of successful transformations, that while difficult, it is absolutely possible** for you to transform your company to the product operating model.
- **Third**, the book will i**nspire you with truly impressive case studies of product innovation**, showing what you too will be capable of doing once you successfully transform.
  
**TRANSFORMED** is written for those driving change, including the senior company leaders—starting with the CEO—as well as the senior executives and stakeholders who need to collaborate with the product teams, the product leaders, the members of the product teams, and all those who either support or depend on these product teams.
