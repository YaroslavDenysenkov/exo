### 1. The "Bible" of Tech Management

**"High Output Management" by Andrew Grove**

- **Why it's essential:** Written by the former CEO of Intel, this is widely considered the best management book for the tech industry. Grove treats meetings not as administrative overhead, but as a **production process**.
    
- **Key Takeaway:** He breaks down meetings into specific "types" with strict rules:
    
    - **Process-oriented meetings:** (Regular staff meetings, 1-on-1s) These should be standardized and routine to _reduce_ cognitive load.
        
    - **Mission-oriented meetings:** Ad-hoc meetings strictly for decision-making. If a decision isn't reached, the meeting failed.
        

### 2. For Agile & Retrospectives (The "Continuous Improvement" Meeting)

**"Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great" by Esther Derby and Diana Larsen**

- **Why it's essential:** In IT, the Retrospective is often the most important (and most often skipped) meeting. This book is the standard manual for Scrum Masters and Tech Leads.
    
- **Key Takeaway:** It provides a specific structure (Set the Stage -> Gather Data -> Generate Insights -> Decide What to Do -> Close) so retrospectives don't just become "complaint sessions" with no action items.
    

### 3. For Engineering Leaders (1-on-1s & Team Syncs)

**"The Manager's Path" by Camille Fournier**

- **Why it's essential:** Fournier (former CTO of Rent the Runway) writes specifically for the career track of a software engineer moving into management.
    
- **Key Takeaway:** She offers excellent, specific advice on how to run **1-on-1s** with engineers (who may be introverted or cynical about management) and how to run "Tech Lead" meetings without micromanaging the code.
    

**"Managing Humans" by Michael Lopp (aka Rands)**

- **Why it's essential:** Lopp is a veteran of Apple, Netscape, and Slack. His writing is humorous and deeply relatable to the "nerd" mindset.
    
- **Key Takeaway:** Read the chapters on "The Update" and "The Rands Test." He explains why engineers hate meetings and how to run them so they actually feel valuable to the developers.
    

### 4. For Fixing "Boring" Meetings

**"Death by Meeting" by Patrick Lencioni**

- **Why it's essential:** While general business, this is highly recommended in IT circles because it solves the issue of the "weekly status update" that puts everyone to sleep.
    
- **Key Takeaway:** Lencioni argues that meetings should have **drama** (conflict and resolution). If your team is bored, it's because you aren't discussing the controversial issues. He suggests splitting meetings into:
    
    - **Daily Check-in:** 5 mins (Standing).
        
    - **Weekly Tactical:** 45-90 mins (Immediate metrics).
        
    - **Monthly Strategic:** 2-4 hours (Deep dive into _one_ big topic).
        

### Summary: Which one should you read first?

- If you are a **CTO or VP**: Read _High Output Management_.
    
- If you are a **Scrum Master**: Read _Agile Retrospectives_.
    
- If you are a **Team Lead/EM**: Read _The Manager's Path_.
    
- If you just want to **fix a boring weekly meeting**: Read _Death by Meeting_.
